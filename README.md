In this project, a dataset sourced from Kaggle was initially imported into Google Colab, where it underwent a thorough examination to ensure accuracy, consistency, and reliability. The raw data was carefully inspected for missing values, duplicates, formatting issues, and inconsistencies that could affect the final analysis. These issues were resolved using systematic data-cleaning techniques, including handling null values, correcting data types, correcting outliers, removing unnecessary entries, and standardizing formats. Once the data quality was ensured, the dataset was further transformed and preprocessed through essential techniques such as encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and new attributes to enhance analytical value. With a clean and well-structured dataset, a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed. This included generating statistical summaries, distribution plots, correlation maps, and various visualizations to uncover meaningful patterns, trends, and relationships hidden within the data. These visual insights provided a clearer understanding of the dataset’s overall highlighted key factors influencing the final outcomes. Based on these findings, the insights were translated into practical recommendations and actionable steps that could support better decision-making, guide future improvements, and deepen the overall understanding of the dataset’s implications.
